This repository contains all files needed to develop **i3flip**, which is one of the scripts included in [i3ass]. 

## files missing
Some files needed to execute **i3flip** successfully are not included in the repository, they are automatically generated with [bashbud] and the command:  
`bashbud --bump` executed in the root directory of this repository.  

For more information about the reasoning behind using [bashbud] see: 
[i3ass-dev/i3ass], it is also recommended to use that repository to setup the development environment for all parts of **i3ass**, since many of them are dependent on each other.

| autogenerated file | purpose 
|:-------------------|:--------
| `init.sh`            | parse options and source content of **lib/** directory
| `program.sh`         | concatenation of `main.sh`, `lib/*` and `init.sh` will be copied to [i3ass/src/i3flip]. Used with `shellcheck` to validate code quality.
| `manpage.md`         | used to as the [wiki page]
| `i3flip.1`           | generated from `manpage.md` with `go-md2man`
